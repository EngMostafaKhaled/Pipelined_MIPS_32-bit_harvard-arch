I am glad to announce that I have managed to design a Pipelined 32-Bit MIPS Micro-Processor (RISC-Like Harvard Architecture) , Using Verilog as HDL.
It provides a hazard control unit that handles both data and control hazards by (Forwarding, Stalling, Flushing ).
The microprocessor was tested to execute the following programs :
-Factorial number calculator (Here shows factorial of 7! )
-GCD (Greatest common divisor).
The design follows The ISA given in a reference that really helped me through implementation: "Digital design and computer architecture" by David M. Harris, With some slight modifications and simple extra instructions.

Here you can find the repo to the project :

Don't forget to star the repo! As I plan to add more sophisticated features to it very soon, God Willing.
